In both settings, informal networks of regulators preceded and existed alongside supranational (federal) regulatory agencies. The literature understood their rationale as preparatory to the creation of higher level agencies. This approach, however, cannot explain why informal regulatory networks still exist, years after the establishment of higher level agencies. What explains the persistence of informal regulatory networks? The argument of this article is that in multilevel governance systems, the relationship between regulatory networks and the supranational level of governance is coevolutionary and embodies struggles for autonomy and authority: as the multilevel governance system consolidates, the character of this relationship evolves from collaborative to competitive. The argument relies on a comparative historical analysis of two voluntary networks of energy regulators from the European Union and the United States, based on 27 interviews and archival research.","tags":[],"title":"Regulatory relationships across levels of multilevel governance systems: From collaboration to competition.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542700800,"objectID":"8d9ea8c5da2d05520de24c04e984ddfc","permalink":"/project/ext_riser/riser/","publishdate":"2018-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/ext_riser/riser/","section":"project","summary":"The governance of sea level rise.","tags":["Sea Level Rise"],"title":"RISER SF Bay - Resilient Infrastructures as Seas Rise.","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project investigates the impact of climate change on transportation infrastructure in California. Specifically, it focuses on the governance structures that are in place to deal with adaptation to sea level rise, addressing its consequences on transportation infrastructure. The project examines specific transportation corridors that are impacted by sea level rise in three different areas of California - the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego County - in comparative perspective.\nSea-level rise is a growing concern for coastal communities in California. Flooding and erosion, exacerbated by rising sea levels, hamper the viability of transportation and other critical infrastructure along California\u0026rsquo;s coasts and bays. Adapting transportation infrastructure to sea-level rise requires collaboration and coordination among policy stakeholders and governments at multiple geographic levels. Increasing collaboration invokes important questions about governance: What kind of governance challenges do stakeholders face in different areas? How are they trying to resolve them? What innovative solutions are emerging across the state? Most importantly, what can stakeholders from different areas learn from each others\u0026rsquo; experiences of collaborative governance?\nThis proposal adopts a theoretical policy learning perspective and answers these questions by carrying out a comparative analysis of collaborative governance in areas where transportation infrastructure is expected to be most vulnerable to sea-level rise. Our initial assessment identified three focal regions: Highway 37 in the San Francisco Bay Area; the Los Angeles - San Diego railroad in San Diego County; and the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County (refining this list is part of the project).\nThe proposal builds on previous work in the Bay Area, but focuses more closely on the adaptive capacity of specific transportation infrastructure as well as a comparative perspective. Methodologically, the project combines analysis of qualitative interviews with stakeholders with quantitative network analysis of their collaborative ties to other actors and policy initiatives. Our outputs will consist of a governance report aimed at policy-makers, academic publications, and a practitioners\u0026rsquo; workshop to share lessons learned to be held in October 2019. The report, in particular, will contain actionable policy recommendations and outline mechanisms to foster cross-regional learning from collaborative governance initiatives.\nThe project is financed by a grant that Mark Lubell and I received from the Institute for Transportation Studies (ITS) at UC Davis, resulting from funding provided by State of California in relation to the SB1 bill. The grant amounts to $80.000 dollars. The project will be completed in October 2019.\n","date":1542700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542700800,"objectID":"ee223b32dd13ad99423135fabb1c8e5e","permalink":"/project/int_slr_sb1/slr_sb1/","publishdate":"2018-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/int_slr_sb1/slr_sb1/","section":"project","summary":"This project investigates the governance structure surrounding specific transportation corridors that are impacted by sea level rise in three different areas of California: the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego County.

This paper posits that informal networks constitute a compensatory mechanism for lacking resources. The hypothesis guiding analysis is that lower resources (operationalised as staff resources) are associated with higher network activism (operationalised as a higher proportion of outgoing ties), particularly for regulators with intermediate levels of resources, for whom the benefits of networking are most likely to outweigh the costs. I test this hypothesis in the empirical case of European national energy regulators, using recent and original data on their bilateral collaboration ties. The results of the statistical analysis lend support to the hypothesis. The results suggest that the interdependence engendered by the European Union improves European regulatory governance by improving national regulatory practice, more than would be possible on the basis of national resources alone.","tags":[],"title":"Networking for resources: how regulators use networks to compensate for lower staff levels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato","Mark Lubell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524207600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524207600,"objectID":"04e35f4443b74e210df1c039bd29251e","permalink":"/talk/wpsa_2019/","publishdate":"2018-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wpsa_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Overlap and segmentation: the structural challenges to adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524207600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524207600,"objectID":"4008a630176b85e01f0dea1dbe7f94e0","permalink":"/publication/jpp/","publishdate":"2018-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jpp/","section":"publication","summary":"The literature on transnational regulatory networks identified interdependence as their main rationale, downplaying domestic factors. Typically, relevant contributions use the word “network” only metaphorically. Yet, informal ties between regulators constitute networked structures of collaboration, which can be measured and explained. Regulators choose their frequent, regular network partners. What explains those choices? This article develops an Exponential Random Graph Model of the network of European national energy regulators to identify the drivers of informal regulatory networking. The results show that regulators tend to network with peers who regulate similarly organised market structures. Geography and European policy frameworks also play a role. Overall, the British regulator is significantly more active and influential than its peers, and a divide emerges between regulators from EU-15 and others. Therefore, formal frameworks of cooperation (i.e. a European Agency) were probably necessary to foster regulatory coordination across the EU.","tags":[],"title":"The drivers of regulatory networking: policy learning between homophily and convergence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato","Mark Lubell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522911600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522911600,"objectID":"3ea8d85caad880f98db16e8858ddb2f3","permalink":"/talk/epg_2019/","publishdate":"2018-04-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/epg_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Networking for legitimacy: adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato","Mark Lubell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522911600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522911600,"objectID":"fed643931aa5a240268674b0dce1a592","permalink":"/talk/mpsa_2019/","publishdate":"2018-04-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mpsa_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The pursuit of coordination in climate change adaptation: sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483257600,"objectID":"0c156981e4892f9596c59e70df3bd9c0","permalink":"/publication/thesis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Networks as levers: the emergence, functioning and export of transnational networks of energy regulators","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.
