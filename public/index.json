In both settings, informal networks of regulators preceded and existed alongside supranational (federal) regulatory agencies. The literature understood their rationale as preparatory to the creation of higher level agencies. This approach, however, cannot explain why informal regulatory networks still exist, years after the establishment of higher level agencies. What explains the persistence of informal regulatory networks? The argument of this article is that in multilevel governance systems, the relationship between regulatory networks and the supranational level of governance is coevolutionary and embodies struggles for autonomy and authority: as the multilevel governance system consolidates, the character of this relationship evolves from collaborative to competitive. The argument relies on a comparative historical analysis of two voluntary networks of energy regulators from the European Union and the United States, based on 27 interviews and archival research.","tags":[],"title":"Regulatory relationships across levels of multilevel governance systems: From collaboration to competition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato","Mark Lubell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554465600,"objectID":"fed643931aa5a240268674b0dce1a592","permalink":"/talk/mpsa_2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mpsa_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The pursuit of coordination in climate change adaptation: sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mark Lubell","Francesca Pia Vantaggiato","Darcy Bostic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553040000,"objectID":"b06d822ed9bed739278c0d0511faf21b","permalink":"/publication/slr_report/","publishdate":"2019-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/slr_report/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Governance of Sea Level Rise in the San Francisco Bay Area: results from a survey of stakeholders.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542672000,"objectID":"05bd1b17122016bd17e460cc4bfb186e","permalink":"/project/ext_riser/","publishdate":"2018-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ext_riser/","section":"project","summary":"The governance of sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area.","tags":["Sea level rise","Governance"],"title":"RISER SF Bay - Resilient Infrastructures as Seas Rise.","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project investigates the impact of climate change on transportation infrastructure in California. Specifically, it focuses on the governance structures that are in place to deal with adaptation to sea level rise, addressing its consequences on transportation infrastructure. The project examines specific transportation corridors that are impacted by sea level rise in three different areas of California - the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego County - in comparative perspective.\nSea-level rise is a growing concern for coastal communities in California. Flooding and erosion, exacerbated by rising sea levels, hamper the viability of transportation and other critical infrastructure along California's coasts and bays. Adapting transportation infrastructure to sea-level rise requires collaboration and coordination among policy stakeholders and governments at multiple geographic levels. Increasing collaboration invokes important questions about governance: What kind of governance challenges do stakeholders face in different areas? How are they trying to resolve them? What innovative solutions are emerging across the state? Most importantly, what can stakeholders from different areas learn from each others\u0026rsquo; experiences of collaborative governance?\nThis proposal adopts a theoretical policy learning perspective and answers these questions by carrying out a comparative analysis of collaborative governance in areas where transportation infrastructure is expected to be most vulnerable to sea-level rise. Our initial assessment identified three focal regions: Highway 37 in the San Francisco Bay Area; the Los Angeles - San Diego railroad in San Diego County; and the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County (refining this list is part of the project).\nThe proposal builds on previous work in the Bay Area, but focuses more closely on the adaptive capacity of specific transportation infrastructure as well as a comparative perspective. Methodologically, the project combines analysis of qualitative interviews with stakeholders with quantitative network analysis of their collaborative ties to other actors and policy initiatives. Our outputs will consist of a governance report aimed at policy-makers, academic publications, and a practitioners\u0026rsquo; workshop to share lessons learned to be held in October 2019. The report, in particular, will contain actionable policy recommendations and outline mechanisms to foster cross-regional learning from collaborative governance initiatives.\nThe project is financed by a grant that Mark Lubell and I received from the Institute for Transportation Studies (ITS) at UC Davis, resulting from funding provided by State of California in relation to the SB1 bill. The grant amounts to $80.000 dollars. The project will be completed in October 2019.\n","date":1542672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542672000,"objectID":"a7b2f44123eddfa40d3a810eeb93cf07","permalink":"/project/int_slr_sb1/","publishdate":"2018-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/int_slr_sb1/","section":"project","summary":"This project investigates the governance structure surrounding specific transportation corridors that are impacted by sea level rise in three different areas of California: the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego County.

This paper posits that informal networks constitute a compensatory mechanism for lacking resources. The hypothesis guiding analysis is that lower resources (operationalised as staff resources) are associated with higher network activism (operationalised as a higher proportion of outgoing ties), particularly for regulators with intermediate levels of resources, for whom the benefits of networking are most likely to outweigh the costs. I test this hypothesis in the empirical case of European national energy regulators, using recent and original data on their bilateral collaboration ties. The results of the statistical analysis lend support to the hypothesis. The results suggest that the interdependence engendered by the European Union improves European regulatory governance by improving national regulatory practice, more than would be possible on the basis of national resources alone.","tags":[],"title":"Networking for resources: how regulators use networks to compensate for lower staff levels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524178800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524178800,"objectID":"72721f19bff2d2cda4ede73268fbd9c5","permalink":"/publication/jcms2019/","publishdate":"2018-04-20T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jcms2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Regulatory networks are usually considered a “second best” instrument of policy integration. They have no decision‐making powers and unclear policy impact. Yet, regulators often play a leading role in establishing their informal networks. Why do regulators initiate networks? I find that regulators form networks to shift the venue of policy discussion from a formal setting, dominated by policy‐makers, to an informal setting, where they share agenda‐setting power with their peers only. Regulators forming networks are “network entrepreneurs”, for whom the establishment of the network is a policy goal in itself. Bolstered by previous positive networking experiences, network entrepreneurs consider networks a first‐best instrument of policy influence. I analyse the empirical case of the network of energy regulators of the Euro‐Mediterranean (MedReg, established in 2006) through 20 elite interviews. The findings hold implications for our understanding of informal regulatory collaboration in the EU and beyond.","tags":[],"title":"Networks as 'first best'?

Typically, relevant contributions use the word “network” only metaphorically. Yet, informal ties between regulators constitute networked structures of collaboration, which can be measured and explained. Regulators choose their frequent, regular network partners. What explains those choices? This article develops an Exponential Random Graph Model of the network of European national energy regulators to identify the drivers of informal regulatory networking. The results show that regulators tend to network with peers who regulate similarly organised market structures. Geography and European policy frameworks also play a role. Overall, the British regulator is significantly more active and influential than its peers, and a divide emerges between regulators from EU-15 and others. Therefore, formal frameworks of cooperation (i.e. a European Agency) were probably necessary to foster regulatory coordination across the EU.","tags":[],"title":"The drivers of regulatory networking: policy learning between homophily and convergence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"0c156981e4892f9596c59e70df3bd9c0","permalink":"/publication/thesis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Networks as levers: the emergence, functioning and export of transnational networks of energy regulators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hussein Kassim","Sara Connolly","Francesca Pia Vantaggiato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"98e7b3c503ac7fb093805c6c07c38f85","permalink":"/publication/gsc_report/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gsc_report/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Understanding the EU Civil Service: The General Secretariat of the Council.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesca Pia Vantaggiato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"4893b31ffa681ca319462a8006130f54","permalink":"/publication/book_chapter1/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/book_chapter1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Euro-Mediterranean Energy Relations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Deller","Francesca Pia Vantaggiato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388620800,"objectID":"a9b0f3f306c627d0473f64d87f9fccbe","permalink":"/publication/reg_state/","publishdate":"2014-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reg_state/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of the ‘Regulatory State’ through the lens of utility regulation. The review is multidisciplinary with it bringing together the insights available from the political science, economics, legal and management science literatures. It is clear that while the term ‘Regulatory State’ is essentially missing from the economics literature a vast array of economics papers provide valuable insights for debates about the Regulatory State within political science. In addition to reviewing the existing literature, the paper identifies opportunities for future research. The literature is grouped into five topics: (i) Consumers, (ii) Courts, (iii) Ideas, Experts and Expertise, (iv) Governance and (v) Assessing Regulator Performance. Apart from (iv), we believe all of these areas have been under-researched in relative terms.

The differences in their origins and structure, which will be outlined in the paper, are offset by the commonality of their goal, that is, to push forward the achievement of “a pan-European energy community”, as in [4]. This fact emphasizes the strategic importance of the regulatory framework in the context of developing the EU energy market. A particularly fertile topic in the European literature on regulatory authorities concerns the issue of regulatory independence, but little investigation has been undertaken to explore what regulators actually do and what are their practices across all electricity market segments, that is generation, distribution, transmission and retail. Therefore, the present paper aims at assessing the state-of-the-art of regulatory practice in the electricity sector in the EU and its neighborhood. This is done by analyzing the regulatory competencies and powers of 34 National Regulatory Authorities, representing a comprehensive sample of countries including both the majority of EU member states and several of its neighbors: members of either or both Energy Community and MedReg.","tags":[],"title":"European Energy Regulation: a Survey Analysis across Electricity Segments","type":"publication"}]
