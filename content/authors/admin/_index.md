Since January 2020, I am Lecturer in Public Policy at King's College London (UK).

Between January 2018 and December 2019, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior (CEPB) of the University of California (Davis). There, I worked on a project focusing on the governance challenges to adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area. I also worked on a parallel project focused on the governance of critical transportation infrastructure corridors impacted by sea level rise in different areas of California (the Bay Area, LA County and San Diego). I am currently working on the publications from these projects.

My research agenda also comprises the study of the European Union as a multi-level governance system. In that context, I am interested in how different governance actors (civil servants, regulators, interest groups, civil society) exploit the gaps between levels of governance to further their interests.
