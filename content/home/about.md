# Research interests

I study governance problems and how actors collaborate in order to solve them. My main research focus is the governance and regulation of infrastructure (energy, transportation, water, telecommunications). I am interested in how public administrators network to their own advantage, and strive to identify what their advantage is. I am also interested in how public administrators make decisions concerning how to distribute the cost of infrastructure across different segments of society. 

Currently, I am studying the governance challenges to adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am a postdoc at the Center for Environmental Policy & Behavior, which is part of the Dept of Environmental Science and Policy Dept at the University of California, Davis. I work in Mark Lubell's lab. I am also carrying out a parallel project focused on the governance of critical transportation infrastructure corridors impacted by sea level rise in different areas of California (the Bay Area, LA County and San Diego).

My research agenda also comprises the study of the European Union as a multi-level governance system. In that context, I am interested in how different governance actors (civil servants, regulators, interest groups, civil society) exploit the gaps between levels of governance to further their interests.
