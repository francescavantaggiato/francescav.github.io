# Research interests

I am a social scientist. I study governance, public policy, and public administration. In particular, my research focuses on how governance actors (governmental and non-governmental) leverage coordination and collaboration to gain access to policy formulation and set agendas. Thematically, my research thus far has focused on the governance challenges associated with developing policy for big infrastructure projects, which create interdependencies across actors and jurisdictions. My research primarily relies on mixed-methods design and quantitative network analysis. 

Since January 2018, I work as post-doctoral researcher in Environmental Policy at the Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior (CEPB), Dept of Environmental Science and Policy, the University of California (Davis). I obtained my PhD in Political Science from the University of East Anglia (Norwich, UK) in December 2017.

Currently, I am working on a project focusing on the governance challenges to adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am also working on a parallel project focused on the governance of critical transportation infrastructure corridors impacted by sea level rise in different areas of California (the Bay Area, LA County and San Diego).

My research agenda also comprises the study of the European Union as a multi-level governance system. In that context, I am interested in how different governance actors (civil servants, regulators, interest groups, civil society) exploit the gaps between levels of governance to further their interests.
